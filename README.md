# CASINO- This is a game designed using C++. Suppose I am a Player and I have total 500rs Money. I deposited My total money and start playing a Casino Game or Number Guessing Game First I took a bid 100rs and I guess the Number 7(Between 1 to 10) if the random number generated by computer is 7 then I can win 10 times of My Bid amount and if I lose My remaining Money is 400rs. Now I can play More until I have a single penny or maybe I can Win or Maybe not.
